"""The month-to-date rule on the OKR scorecard (Ross, 09/10/2026).

A per-month KR scores ONLY when its month is closed OR the month already holds
>= OKR_MTD_MIN_DAYS (7) days of the KR's own source data. Otherwise its value is
shown with an "MTD" suffix, score and RAG are null, the basis says
"month-to-date, not yet scored (n days of data)", and the objective % leaves
the row out. On 01/10/2026 OO3 KR4 read 100% / score 100 / green from one day
of October; this is the rule that stops that.

Runs the REAL builder over a hand-built archive of factory broth readings -
the cleanest monthly KR to drive, because its "days of data" is the number of
production days with a graded reading:
  * Tonkotsu: September (closed, 3 production days) and October (3 days)
  * Chicken:  October only, 8 production days
baked as of 2026-10-09. So:
  * Tonkotsu September is CLOSED  -> scored despite only 3 days
  * Tonkotsu October has 3 days   -> MTD, unscored, value still shown
  * Chicken October has 8 days    -> scored
  * the OO5 objective % for October is Chicken's score alone, "1 of 5"
And the fallback this replaces: a monthly KR with no figure at all for the
pull month must not wear the previous month's figure under this month's name.

"""A back-bake sees the archive exactly as it stood on its own date (09/10/2026).

`bake_ops_command.py --date D` used to name the output file and do nothing
else: every "newest pull of this feed" query, the feed-health ages, the current
Mon-Sun week, the Facilities age and the trend history all came from TODAY. So
back-baking 2 October on the 9th - which is what recovering the 02/10-08/10 gap
left by the dead OPS_REPO_TOKEN needs - would have written a file called
snapshot_2026-10-02.json full of 9 October's data. Nothing would have failed;
the month picker would just have shown the wrong numbers under the right date.

This runs the REAL builder over a hand-built archive with pulls on both sides
of the bake date and pins what a dated bake may and may not see. Synthetic and
tiny on purpose: it must run in seconds with no network and no warehouse.

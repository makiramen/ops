verify_ops_data.py -- the daily verification spine (verify.yml).

Every daily process in this system must either prove it worked or fail
loudly, and "proved it worked" is always measured at the DESTINATION --
Neon Postgres and the live dashboard -- never at a workflow's own exit
code. This script is the safety net under the ETL's own loud-failure
receipts (etl_receipt.py in MakiManc/maki-hospitality-etl).

Driven by data/ops_command/feeds_manifest.json -- the single home for the
system's expectations.

CHECKS (v2, Phase 2 complete)
  check 0  RUN RECEIPTS    etl_run_log has a receipt for today's
                           daily-export and deep-pull runs. Exit 0 is not
                           enough on its own: exit 0 with ZERO rows
                           written, or exit 0 with failed feeds, is a
                           critical. (25 Aug 2026: the receipt row said
                           exit 0 / 0 rows / every feed failed while the
                           workflow itself was red, and this check called
                           it ok.)
  check 1  FEEDS LANDED    every status=expected or best_effort feed has
                           landed within its cadence_days (1 = daily; the
                           three weekly Kobas email reports are 8). Measured
                           at the store (the §13 class). A feed inside a
                           multi-day cadence with no pull today also SKIPS
                           check 2 -- otherwise the floor check fires "0 rows"
                           on the days it was never due, which is how giving a
                           weekly report its real cadence moves the red
                           instead of clearing it.
  check 2  ROWS SANE       today's rows >= manifest floor and within a
                           0.5x-3x band of the trailing 14-day median
                           (falls back to the calibration median while
                           post-trim Neon history is thin).
  check 3  EVENTS FRESH    for manifest feeds with event_date_field: the
                           max event date INSIDE the data is recent per
                           the feed's event_fresh_days. Catches pulls that
                           keep landing while the upstream silently serves
                           a frozen window -- including a Kobas report that
                           stopped being produced while its last email is
                           re-served daily from the 14-day IMAP window, which
                           NO arrival check can see. Severity mirrors the
                           feed's tier (critical for expected in a priority
                           domain); it was pinned to warning until 03/09/2026,
                           which is why it named the Outstanding Stock Orders
                           stoppage six days early and was not acted on.
  check 4a SNAPSHOT FRESH  the live snapshot_index.json says the same
                           latest data date as Postgres (raw GitHub
                           primary; Pages CDN informative only).
  check 4b CONSISTENT      the REAL builder (bake_ops_command.py, copied
                           to a temp dir and run against today's
                           warehouse -- same code, no drift) must produce
                           the same headline aggregates as the live baked
                           snapshot: scheduled-task on-time/missed totals,
                           projected-spend GBP total, broth cell count,
                           factory refractometer reading count,
                           supplier-issue count, outstanding-training
                           count. Catches a correct warehouse feeding a
                           wrong dashboard.
  check 5  NOTHING BLIND   feeds present in Postgres today but absent
                           from the manifest raise warnings -- the
                           manifest cannot quietly fall behind reality.
  check 6  SIDE CHANNELS   maintenance_source.json age (>7 days without a
                           refresh commit suggests the refresh chain is
                           dead) and DB size (warn at 400 MB, CRITICAL at
                           450 -- Neon free cap is 512 MB and a rejected
                           insert loses the day; the archive+trim keeps
                           steady state near 300 MB).

MORNING vs RECHECK (the false-alarm damper, plan §1)
  Morning run (since 01/09/2026 chained to the Ops Command bake finishing,
  ~09:00 UTC on a normal day, rather than a 09:30 cron GitHub was firing
  hours late): timing-deferrable criticals -- a feed missing
  while its producing run has no receipt yet (may still be in flight),
  a stale snapshot, a 4b mismatch or recompute crash -- are recorded as
  "deferred" (overall amber, no push, exit 0). Everything genuinely
  broken (receipt says exit!=0, feed missing though its run finished
  fine, floor breach, DSN dead) still alerts immediately.
  12:00 UTC recheck run: no deferral -- anything still failing pushes.
  Mode is chosen by UTC hour (>= 11 -> recheck).

ALSO WRITTEN EACH RUN
  data/ops_command/health_latest.json   full verdict (banner + Data
                                        Health tab read this)
  data/ops_command/verify_history.json  rolling 60-entry run history
                                        (7-day strip + alive-push source)
  ops_daily_aggregates (Postgres)       per-site daily aggregates upserted
                                        from the recompute snapshot --
                                        tasks on-time/missed, broth cells,
                                        supplier issues. This is the
                                        approved history archive: it
                                        accumulates beyond the feeds' own
                                        rolling windows (open item 5). A
                                        failed upsert is a CRITICAL -- it
                                        is usually the first sign the
                                        store itself is refusing writes.

MONDAY ALIVE-PUSH: silence-as-healthy is only trustworthy while the
checker is provably alive, so every Monday morning run sends one push --
"verifier alive - N/7 days green" -- regardless of status.

Env: WAREHOUSE_DSN (required), NTFY_TOPIC (optional -- degrades to log).

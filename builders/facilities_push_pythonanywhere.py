"""Push the Facilities app's PPM summary to the ops repo, FROM PythonAnywhere.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Ross, 09/10/2026)
----------------------------------
The dashboard's Facilities figures (OO2 KR1/KR2/KR4 and the Maintenance tab)
come from the app's /api/ppm_summary feed. Until now the only route was a
PULL: the Ops Command bake, running on GitHub Actions, calls the app with
FACILITIES_API_KEY. When that call fails - app asleep or expired, key rotated,
GitHub's runner unable to reach PythonAnywhere - nothing arrives, and on
25/09/2026 that left the three KRs grey for a fortnight.

This is the PUSH route, run on the app's own side of the wire. A daily
scheduled task on PythonAnywhere fetches the same summary from the app and
writes it to MakiManc/ops as data/ops_command/facilities_ppm_pushed.json via
GitHub's Contents API. The bake reads both copies and uses whichever was
pulled more recently (bake_ops_command.load_facilities_best), so either route
alone keeps the figures fresh, and a stale copy never overrides a fresh one.

It writes a SEPARATE file from the bake's facilities_ppm.json on purpose: two
writers on one file would race, and the pull/push timestamps would stop
meaning which route delivered what.

INSTALL (once, on PythonAnywhere - Ross)
----------------------------------------
1. Upload this file to your PythonAnywhere home, e.g.
       /home/rossmward/ops_push/facilities_push_pythonanywhere.py
   It needs nothing beyond the standard library.

2. Create the secrets file, readable by you only:
       nano /home/rossmward/.ops_push.env
       chmod 600 /home/rossmward/.ops_push.env
   with exactly these two lines (values are yours; do not paste them anywhere
   else):
       OPS_PUSH_TOKEN=<a fine-grained PAT - see below>
       FACILITIES_API_KEY=<the API_KEY value from the app's config_secrets.py>

   THE TWO SECRETS
   * OPS_PUSH_TOKEN - a NEW fine-grained personal access token, made at
     https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens :
       Resource owner MakiManc; Only select repositories: MakiManc/ops;
       Repository permissions: Contents = Read and write; nothing else.
     Set an expiry and put a reminder in your calendar a week before it -
     when it expires this script fails with "GitHub rejected OPS_PUSH_TOKEN"
     and the bake's own pull becomes the only route again. Do not reuse
     OPS_REPO_TOKEN from maki-hospitality-etl: one leak, one token to revoke.
   * FACILITIES_API_KEY - the SAME value as the app's API_KEY in
     config_secrets.py (and as the FACILITIES_API_KEY secret the bake uses).
     It is how this script authenticates to the app's own feed.

3. Test it by hand from a Bash console:
       python3 /home/rossmward/ops_push/facilities_push_pythonanywhere.py --dry-run
   (fetches and checks the feed, pushes nothing), then without --dry-run.
   A free PythonAnywhere account can only reach whitelisted sites; api.github.com
   is on the whitelist (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/). If the push
   fails with a connection error rather than an HTTP status, check that first.
   A successful push prints the commit URL; the file appears at
   https://github.com/MakiManc/ops/blob/main/data/ops_command/facilities_ppm_pushed.json

4. Tasks tab -> Scheduled tasks -> daily at 06:30 (UTC on PythonAnywhere):
       python3 /home/rossmward/ops_push/facilities_push_pythonanywhere.py
   06:30 lands it before the 08:17 export and the bake that follows. The task
   log (Tasks tab) holds each run's output; a failed run exits non-zero.

WHAT IT PRINTS. The HTTP status of each call and, on a failure, the first 300
characters of the reply - never either secret. Exit 0 pushed (or dry run OK),
1 the app's feed could not be fetched or failed the shape check, 2 a secret is
missing, 3 GitHub refused the write.

Options (environment variables, all optional): FACILITIES_FEED_URL (default
the app's own /api/ppm_summary), OPS_PUSH_ENV_FILE (default ~/.ops_push.env),
OPS_PUSH_REPO (default MakiManc/ops), OPS_PUSH_BRANCH (default main).

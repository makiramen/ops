"""Read the warehouse from the committed archive instead of Postgres.

Phase 2 of moving the ops warehouse off Neon. Presents the gzipped pull archive
(warehouse_direct/ or warehouse_archive/, both the same format) through a DuckDB
connection shaped like the psycopg2 one bake_ops_command.py already uses, so the
bake's 27 queries run against files with no rewrite.

    conn = archive_source.connect("/path/to/warehouse_direct")
    cur  = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT ... FROM etl_feed_rows WHERE feed=%s", ("Kobas Orders",))

NOTHING SWITCHES TO THIS AUTOMATICALLY. bake_ops_command.py uses it only when
OPS_WAREHOUSE_SOURCE=archive, so the default path is untouched and the two can be
run back to back and diffed.

TWO DIRECTORIES, ONE WAREHOUSE
------------------------------
The archive arrived by two routes and neither covers the whole span. Pulls from
13/08/2026 were archived out of Postgres into warehouse_archive/; from 27/08/2026
the export writes warehouse_direct/ itself. Reading either one alone is wrong in
a different direction - archive-only goes stale the day Neon stops being written,
direct-only silently drops every pull before it existed - so connect() takes
several directories joined by os.pathsep, in PRECEDENCE order:

    connect("warehouse_direct" + os.pathsep + "warehouse_archive")

Files are resolved per (pull_date, filename), and the FIRST directory that has one
wins; the rest are skipped, not concatenated. Concatenating would double every row
of every overlapping pull - a silent doubling of the whole dashboard, since both
routes write the same pull_date on the same day.

Direct wins over archive because it is first-hand. archive_writer.write_pull is
atomic (write .tmp, verify the gzip line count round-trips, rename), so a file
present there is a complete file; warehouse_archive/ is a dump of whatever
Postgres held, which on 26/08/2026 - Neon at its 512 MB cap, zero rows stored,
every fetch fine - was nothing at all.

DIALECT - VERIFIED AGAINST DUCKDB 1.5.5, NOT ASSUMED
----------------------------------------------------
These behave identically to Postgres and need no translation:
    DISTINCT ON              count(*) FILTER (WHERE ...)     string_agg
    date_trunc('week', ...)  + INTERVAL '6 day'              substr
    ::text ::date ::int      nullif(...)                     ->>
    date - date -> INTEGER   (the feed-health staleness column relies on this;
                              it was the one I expected to differ, and it does not)

Two differences do need translating, both mechanical:
    %s -> ?          psycopg2 positional params
    bare alias       Postgres accepts `data->>'Order Ref' ref`; DuckDB needs AS

One difference is NOT translated and is a trap - `~` MEANS SOMETHING ELSE HERE.
Postgres' ~ searches; DuckDB's ~ is regexp_full_match. 'abc' ~ 'b' is TRUE on
Postgres and FALSE here. A start-anchored pattern is what catches people out,
because it looks portable and is not: '2026-09-10T09:00:00' ~ '^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}'
is true on Postgres and false here, so the two engines quietly return different
rows rather than one of them failing. No query in either repo relies on it today
(the ETL sibling's pg_extract._as_date is the only ~ anywhere, and it spells out
a '.*' tail so it means the same under both readings). Do the same, or add a
rule, before using ~ in the bake. Recorded here because the sibling found it:
this file and archive_query.py must not diverge on dialect.

THE `data` COLUMN IS PINNED TO JSON, NOT AUTO-DETECTED
------------------------------------------------------
This used to be read_json_auto with CAST(data AS JSON) over the top, and what
DuckDB inferred depended on HOW MANY FEEDS THE FILE SET HAPPENED TO COVER:

    ~50 feeds  -> MAP(VARCHAR, JSON), on which every ->> silently returns NULL
    one pull   -> a typed STRUCT, which then dies outright on the first pair of
                  keys differing only in case:
                  "Duplicate name \"Language\" in struct auto-detected in JSON"

So the same code read the fortnight-wide archive fine and could not read a single
day of it - a property of the input, discoverable only by trying. read_json with
an explicit columns= pins row_num and data to BIGINT and JSON whatever the set
looks like, which is what the archive envelope has always been. The CAST is kept
below as a free no-op so the intent survives if anyone loosens this again.

FEED NAMES
----------
The archive filename is a lossy slug ([^A-Za-z0-9]+ -> _), so the real feed name
is read from the _feeds.json that archive_writer.py writes per pull date. Older
pulls predate that file; for those the name is recovered from the feeds manifest,
and anything still unresolved keeps its slug so a query for it returns nothing
rather than silently matching the wrong feed.

bake_ops_command.py  -- Pipe 9 (Ops Command daily snapshot)
Bakes one data/ops_command/snapshot_<pull_date>.json per day for the Ops Command
dashboard (command/index.html + the desktop artifact), and prepends the date to
snapshot_index.json. Structured JSON replaces the markdown-pipe-table SNAPSHOT
string the artifact used to carry between SNAPSHOT-START/END markers.
SOURCE
  Neon Postgres warehouse (system of record for all ETL feeds), table
  etl_feed_rows(feed, pull_date, row_num, data jsonb, loaded_at).
  Connection : WAREHOUSE_DSN env var (the same secret the ETL workflows use).
  This pipe reads the warehouse DIRECTLY -- the "Ops Command KPIs" Google Sheet
  is a serving layer for chat sessions, not a source, and reading it back as
  text was two lossy hops for data that started structured (13/08/2026).
TRAPS, WITH DATES (house rule: write them down where the next person will look)
  * DEEP vs DAILY FEED NAMESPACES (13/08/2026). The 03:00 deep pull and the
    08:15 daily export both wrote feed 'Flow Modules' with the same pull_date,
    and pg_loader replaces per (feed, pull_date) -- so the export's ~456-row
    module CATALOGUE clobbered the ~4,700-row per-trainee pull every morning.
    Fixed by namespacing: per-trainee data is 'Deep Flow Modules' etc. This pipe
    PROBES for the Deep feed and falls back to the un-prefixed one, and always
    records which it used in the block's `source_feed`.
  * Flow Trainees.branch holds a branch ID, not a name (13/08/2026). Join
    through Flow Branches id -> name or every site reads "121711".
  * module_status is COMPOSITE, comma-joined: 'In Progress, Overdue',
    'Not Yet Started, Overdue' (13/08/2026). Overdue is a flag on top of a
    state -- match as a substring; = 'Overdue' silently finds nothing. Never
    render Overdue as a stack segment beside the states: it double-counts.
  * Flow Certificates exposes NO expiry field (only certificate_url,
    module_name, trainee_id) (13/08/2026). Emitted as a `gaps` entry every run
    so the blind spot stays visible until the source improves.
  * SUPPLIER ATTRIBUTION (13/08/2026, resolved same day). The Delivery/
    Supplier Issue Form HAS a 'Supplier?' task (free-text 'Supplier Name').
    'GC Form Task Answers' first LANDED in the warehouse with run #35 on
    13/08/2026 (earlier probes found it absent - that was timing: the pg
    dual-write was only added 12/08 and the sheet tab's idempotent skip
    bypassed it). Each pull covers a rolling ~7-day window, so this pipe
    dedupes by FormId/AnswerID ACROSS pull_dates - history accumulates from
    13/08/2026 onward. First real data: Lynas 14 answered issues in 7 days
    while form-TITLE attribution showed Lynas 0. Titles lie; answers don't.
  * EVENT DATES vs PULL DATES (13/08/2026). Date-range filtering must slice
    on the event's own date - AnsweredDateTime for form answers/issues,
    module_completed_date for training - never on pull_date. pull_date is
    when the ETL ran, not when the thing happened.
  * module_completed_date is UK-format 'DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM' (13/08/2026);
    AnsweredDateTime is ISO. Both parsed defensively, bad values skipped.
  * "Sosltice" is a live typo in a GetCompliant form title (13/08/2026). Both
    spellings map to supplier Solstice here; fix at source when possible.
  * GC Forms Overview LocationGroupName/Id are entirely null (13/08/2026), so
    form completion cannot be split by site -- only by form and folder.
  * The legacy Feed Status ('ok'/'failed'/'empty') reflects the SHEETS write,
    not the data: the warehouse sheet hit Google's 10M-cell ceiling on
    12/08/2026 and healthy feeds were stamped 'empty'. Feed health here is
    measured against Postgres row counts, which is the point of this pipe.
  * SQL uses position(x in y), never LIKE -- no literal '%' in query strings,
    so psycopg parameter substitution can't be tripped (13/08/2026).
HOUSE RULES HONOURED
  nulls + a named entry in `gaps`, never silent zeros; every derived signal
  carries a `basis` string; independent data families are independent blocks;
  the site map lives in this builder, not the shell; history is append-only
  (dated files, index prepended, nothing rewritten).
USAGE
  WAREHOUSE_DSN=postgres://... python3 builders/bake_ops_command.py [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
  Writes data/ops_command/snapshot_<date>.json and updates snapshot_index.json.
  Exit 0 on success, 1 on any failure (nothing partially written).

    Three real cases, all confirmed against the batch's own before-ice
    reading (28/08/2026) - every one of these was previously being mangled or
    dropped, and Ross's instruction was to ignore no reading:

      '8,7'    DECIMAL COMMA. Staff type it as often as a point. The old code
               stripped commas as thousands separators, turning 8.7 into 87 -

               (8,7 / 8,0 / 8,0 / 5,2) were wrong this way, and they were the
               reason a 'suspect' rule existed at all.
      '8.4’'   TRAILING JUNK. A stray typographic apostrophe. float() raised,
               so the reading was dropped entirely and counted as non-numeric.
      '8.60%'  PERCENT-FORMATTED CELL. The cell really does hold 0.086 - the
               person typed 8.6 into a cell someone had formatted as a
               percentage. Dividing by 100 is right about the cell and wrong
               about the batch, so where /100 lands outside anything a
               refractometer can read AND the face value is plausible, the
               face value wins. '900.00%' still reads as 9 (900/100), which
               is what the sheet's derived tabs contain.

    Anything genuinely non-numeric is still None, counted, and never guessed

    The form's own 'Date' field is the right field to PREFER: a batch made late
    one night is often submitted the next morning, and the operator dates it to
    the production day rather than the submission day.

    But it is hand-typed next to an automatic Timestamp, so it is trusted only
    when it PARSES and is PLAUSIBLE - and those are two different tests:
      * doesn't parse: '03/08/0025' for 03/08/2025.
      * parses and is wrong: batch 080925B is dated 08/09/2024 and was
        submitted 08/09/2025. Exactly a year out, perfectly well-formed, and
        contradicted by the batch number itself, which reads 08/09/25.
    A production date AFTER its own submission is impossible, and one more than
    FB_MAX_LAG_DAYS before it is a slip rather than a late entry: 3 readings of
    1,461 in the first full pull were 14, 30 and 365 days out, and every one of
    them was contradicted by its own batch number. Left alone, the 365-day one
    stretched the dashboard's whole date range back a year on its own.

    # ---- scheduled task completion rate ON TIME by site (GC Scheduled Task Answers) ----
    # Ross, 15 Aug: the Task Completion page was reading GC Form Task Answers
    # (Closed/Open FORM state - a current-state backlog snapshot). Ross asked
    # for the SCHEDULED task on-time completion rate instead - a different
    # feed, a different question ("did the recurring checklist get done by
    # its deadline"), and it turns out to be naturally event-dated rather
    # than a snapshot.
    #
    # GC Scheduled Task Answers carries every recurring checklist item
    # (cleaning, prep, temperature, broth checks, etc: 40+ distinct TaskName
    # values, ~36k rows per pull across 23 sites) with a genuine
    # DueDateTime and a system-computed IsSystemOverdue flag. When a task
    # is completed before its DueDateTime, IsSystemOverdue=false and Answer
    # carries the real response. When nobody completes it in time,
    # GetCompliant auto-closes the row at the deadline with
    # Answer='Not registered on time' and IsSystemOverdue=true - checked
    # live: 100% correlation between IsSystemOverdue=true and that exact
    # Answer text, across every row in the latest pull.
    #
    # Cross-pull dedup by AnswerID (the pattern used everywhere else in this
    # builder) does NOT work here: the auto-closed "missed" rows carry a
    # BLANK AnswerID (verified live - all 1,463 of them in one pull
    # collapsed to a single DISTINCT ON row, silently discarding the rest).
    # TaskID+DueDateTime isn't a safe substitute either - the same task can
    # recur more than once a day sharing an identical nominal due timestamp
    # (checked live: 36,457 rows but only 2,625 distinct TaskID+DueDateTime
    # pairs in one pull). Rather than invent a fragile synthetic key, this
    # block reads the MOST RECENT PULL ONLY. Each pull already carries a
    # trailing ~7-9 day window on its own (verified live), so this still
    # gives a meaningful multi-day picture and refreshes cleanly every day
    # Pipe 9 runs - it just doesn't accumulate a longer history the way the
    # AnswerID-keyed feeds do.

    # ---- supply / projected spend this week, by site + supplier ----
    # Ross, 17 Aug: replace the "orders outstanding" aging/backlog framing
    # with a forward-looking view - what do we expect to SPEND this week,
    # broken down by site and supplier. "This week" = the Mon-Sun week
    # containing today (Postgres current_date), matched against each order's
    # own delivery date. Site+supplier is a genuinely new cut: the old aging
    # block only ever grouped by supplier (site was fetched but unused).
    #
    # SOURCE CHANGE (26/08/2026). The primary source is now the 'Kobas Order
    # Emails' feed - a daily IMAP parse of the confirmation emails Kobas sends
    # to ross@makiramen.com. It replaces the 'Kobas Pending Orders' route,
    # which logged in to Kobas headlessly and committed a JSON file into the
    # ETL repo for this workflow to check out. That route never once completed
    # in Actions; the checkout step and its ETL_REPO_TOKEN are gone, and this
    # builder no longer reads any checked-out etl-data/ directory. The email
    # feed arrives in the warehouse like every other feed.
    #
    # WHAT THE EMAIL SOURCE CANNOT DO, STATED PLAINLY (26/08/2026):
    #  * NO DELIVERED/PENDING SPLIT. Confirmation emails record an order being
    #    placed and carry no status. The split that the pending-orders route
    #    supported is REMOVED rather than faked - week_totals has no
    #    delivered/pending keys on this source and the site boxes carry no
    #    split bar.
    #  * PARTIAL SUPPLIER COVERAGE. Kobas only emails a confirmation for
    #    suppliers configured to receive their orders by email. On discovery
    #    that was 6 of 31 estate suppliers (LWC depots, Brakes, Perfect Ted);
    #    Lynas, HARRO, JFC, TRUE WORLD FOODS, Solstice and AA Factory transmit
    #    another way and produce nothing, which is ~80% of estate spend. Ross
    #    is switching the rest on in Kobas, so coverage grows by itself.
    #    Nothing here filters by supplier - a new supplier appears the day its
    #    first email lands. The shortfall is measured below against the weekly
    #    outstanding-orders report and emitted as a named gap listing exactly
    #    which suppliers are still missing, so it self-clears as Ross works
    #    through them.
    #  * CANCELLATIONS ARE INVISIBLE. An order cancelled in Kobas without a
    #    re-sent email stays in the week's total.

    # Ross, 01/09/2026: update the price watch every time the report arrives,
    # and flag (1) an increase that has since held, (2) a price that keeps
    # moving. Both need HISTORY, and this block used to read exactly one pull
    # - so it showed the newest report and nothing else, and had no way to
    # know whether a rise had stuck or a price had bounced.
    #
    # WHAT A "REPORT" IS. Kobas emails this weekly; the export pulls it every
    # day, so the same report is archived several days running. Four distinct
    # reports arrived in the ten pulls to 31/08. So the unit of time here is a
    # DISTINCT REPORT, identified by its content, dated by the first pull that
    # carried it - not pull_date, which would count one report four times and
    # make every price look like it changed daily.
    #
    # Dating by first-seen is deliberately conservative. A pull gap (an export
    # that failed, or the 3-day email window that lost the 24-31/08 report on
    # three days) can only make a report look NEWER than it is, so the
    # "held for N days" test under-states age and never over-fires.
    #
    # WHAT A ROW IS. Each row is one change EVENT, not one item: an item can
    # appear several times in a single report, and the report carries no
    # per-event timestamp, so within a report the only ordering is row_num.
    # 'Old Price' is the literal string 'New' for an item priced for the first

    # tasks, with the comments/updates on each. There is no maintenance feed in
    # the Neon warehouse (checked all 43 feeds), no structured tracker in Asana
    # (checked live - only ad-hoc meeting-note tasks), and no GetCompliant form
    # for it either (checked GC Forms - no maintenance/repair/facilities form
    # exists). The real tracker is a Google Sheet Lincoln maintains by hand:
    # "Required Maintenance/Repair (Responses)", confirmed as the source with
    # Ross. That sheet has no live API wired into Pipe 9 (GitHub Actions has no
    # Google credential, and adding one is a Ross-side credential step - see
    # gaps note below) so this block reads a committed companion file,
    # data/ops_command/maintenance_source.json, instead of querying Postgres.
    # That file is produced by pulling the sheet's most recent curated section
    # ("UPDATED AS OF <date>" - ON GOING/PENDING + DONE tables) via the Drive
    # connector and normalizing site labels (the sheet uses short codes like
    # M12/Maki 12 - mapped to the same canonical site names used everywhere
    # else on this dashboard via a legend cross-checked against the internal
    # "SITE OVERVIEW" directory doc). It is refreshed by re-running that pull,

"""Refresh data/ops_command/maintenance_source.json from Lincoln's sheet.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The Maintenance tab was frozen for three weeks (source_as_of
2026-08-19, pulled 2026-08-25) and the reason was structural, not neglect:
the refresh was done by hand through a browser connector, and the scheduled
task that was supposed to do it runs headless in GitHub Actions with no
browser. Fifteen consecutive scheduled refreshes built the data and could not
commit it. A job that can only succeed when a human is watching is not a
scheduled job.

WHAT CHANGED. Nothing about the credential - and that is the point. The ETL
has had a Google service account (GOOGLE_SA_JSON) since external_sheets.py
went in, and external_sheets.py ALREADY reads this exact spreadsheet id every
day. It just writes it to a tab in the KPI workbook, which the bake cannot
see. So the sheet was never unreachable from Actions; the parsed form of it
simply had no automated path into data/ops_command/. This script is that path.
No new secret, no browser, no Ross-side credential step.

Run it before the bake, in the workflow that already checks out the ops repo
and holds the push token (ops_command_bake.yml). It writes the same JSON
schema bake_ops_command.py already reads, so nothing downstream changes.

FAIL SOFT, ALWAYS. If the sheet cannot be read - access revoked, tab renamed,
Google down - this leaves the existing committed file untouched and exits 0
with a loud log. A maintenance refresh must never be the reason the whole
dashboard fails to bake. Staleness is visible on the tab (source_as_of is
rendered); a failed bake is not.

# 'Ikigai 2' resolves to the site 'Iki 2' already resolved to in the set Ross

# Counts below are from the live worksheet, 1,265 submissions, 16/09/2026:

#     Edinburgh' (4), 'Factory - Renfield St, Glasgow' (17) - four spellings of

#     Limited, and mapping an Edinburgh or Glasgow factory onto it would
#     attribute one site's maintenance to another.
#   'Maki 4' and 'Maki 2' both left this list on 16/09/2026, when Ross said what
#     they were - M4 is Leith, M2 is half of M1/2. What remains below is not a
#     backlog of unanswered labels; it is four things that are not trading sites
#     and one that is not confirmed.
#   'RHQ' (22) - head office, not a trading site.
#   'IKIGAI 1' (3) - Iki 2 is South Ikigai Ltd; there is no confirmed Iki 1 on
#     this dashboard, so this is not assumed to be the same place.
#   'Grindlay Flat' (4) - a flat, not a site.
# All of them surface in unresolved_site_labels and are named in the gap the
# baker puts on the Maintenance tab.

/**
 * Checks Mintsoft credentials. READ ONLY, and prints no secret.
 *
 *   npm run check:credentials
 *
 * Mintsoft accepts one thing on the wire — an `ms-apikey` header — but there are three
 * ways to end up holding one, and they are not interchangeable. This checks whichever
 * are present, independently, and says what each is good for:
 *
 *   MINTSOFT_USERNAME + MINTSOFT_PASSWORD  the API user's login. Exchanged at POST
 *                                          /api/Auth for a key, and re-exchanged when
 *                                          that key expires. The only form that can
 *                                          drive the scheduled sync.
 *   MINTSOFT_API_KEY                       a key already minted. Dies 24 hours after it
 *                                          was issued and cannot be renewed here, so it
 *                                          suits a one-off run and nothing more.
 *   MINTSOFT_PROXY_AUTH=true               the key lives upstream and a proxy attaches
 *                                          it. Never enters this process at all.
 *
 * Each form is checked by reading /api/Client and /api/Warehouse — both on the client's
 * read allow-list, both harmless. Names are printed because "which clients can this user
 * see?" is the question that decides whether we are safely scoped to Maki & Ramen. No
 * other field is read, nothing is written, and nothing is dumped to disk.

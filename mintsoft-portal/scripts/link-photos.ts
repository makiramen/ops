/**
 * Matches product photos on disk to Maki products, and emits the SQL to link them.
 *
 *   npm run photos              # report what is matched and what is still missing
 *   npm run photos -- --out seed/photos.sql
 *   npm run photos -- --local   # against the local database instead of the live one
 *
 * The product list comes from the deployed database, read through wrangler.
 *
 * Mintsoft cannot supply these. 135 of its 337 lines carry an ImageURL, but every one
 * points at om.mintsoft.co.uk/Image/GetImage/<id>, which answers 500 both anonymously
 * and with a valid API key — it is the web UI's host and wants a browser session, not
 * an API key. So the photos are ours to hold, which DISCOVERY.md left open and this
 * settles.
 *
 * Drop files in public/products/ named after the ITEM CODE, which is the SKU with the
 * MRK<shipment> prefix stripped:
 *
 *     MRK005-BCB, MRK010-BCB, MRK011-BCB   ->   BCB.jpg
 *
 * One photo covers every shipment of the same item, which is the whole point of the
 * mapping: a GM sees one product, not eight. Matching is case-insensitive and accepts
 * .jpg .jpeg .png .webp.
 *
 * Vite copies public/ into dist/, so a photo is live at /products/<CODE>.jpg the next
 * time the portal is deployed. No object store, no upload endpoint, no extra
 * credentials — a photo is a commit, the same way a stock refresh is.

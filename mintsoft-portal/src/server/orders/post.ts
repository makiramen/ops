/**
 * Sending an approved order to Mintsoft. The only write the portal ever makes.
 *
 * Three things from Phase 0 shape this, and each one is a way to lose or duplicate a
 * real order:
 *
 *   1. MINTSOFT HAS NO IDEMPOTENCY. No key header, no dedupe on order number. Send the
 *      same order twice and Mercium picks, ships and bills it twice. Every safeguard is
 *      ours.
 *   2. HTTP 200 DOES NOT MEAN CREATED. PUT /api/Order returns an array, and each element
 *      carries its own Success flag and Message. A failure comes back as a 200 with
 *      Success:false. Treating the status code as the answer loses orders silently,
 *      which is the worst failure this system has: the GM sees "sent" and nothing comes.
 *   3. "NOT FOUND" DOES NOT MEAN "SAFE TO CREATE". Mintsoft's own description of the
 *      lookup's 404 is "Order not found or not accessible" — one status for two very
 *      different situations. If the order exists but our key cannot see it, re-creating
 *      produces exactly the duplicate we were avoiding.
 *
 * So the lookup has three outcomes, not two, and only two of them are safe to act on.

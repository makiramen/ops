/**
 * A deliberately read-only Mintsoft client, used by Phase 0 discovery.
 *
 * Restricting ourselves to GET is NOT sufficient safety on this API. Around twenty of
 * Mintsoft's state-changing operations are exposed as HTTP GETs -- among them
 * GET /api/Order/{id}/MarkDespatched, GET /api/ASN/{id}/BookIn and
 * GET /api/Order/{id}/Cancel. A mistyped path or a copied snippet could book in a
 * shipment or mark an order despatched, and the verb would look entirely innocent.
 *
 * So the guarantee here is not "we only use GET". It is an explicit allow-list: this
 * client refuses to request any path that is not one of the named read endpoints below,
 * and it refuses before the request goes out. The only non-GET is the POST to /api/Auth
 * that exchanges credentials for a key.
 *
 * The portal's own client (Phase 2+) adds exactly one write — PUT /api/Order — behind
 * the MINTSOFT_WRITES_ENABLED flag and an approver check. Nothing else is ever written.
